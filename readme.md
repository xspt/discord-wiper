This is a script I made to bulk delete my messages in Discord.

To use it you need to add the following values:

```
const token = ""; // YOUR TOKEN
const authorId = ""; // YOUR USER ID
const channelId = ""; // CHANNEL ID (If it is a guild channel id, the script will delete all your messages from that guild)
```
